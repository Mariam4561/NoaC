    <h2>Sour Taste</h2>
    <p id="y">Taste as we know it defines a great deal of our life experiences and personalities. But how much do we really know about how we detect our favourite foods? The answer: not as much as you might think. This has not stopped the sprawling research into answering this and questions like it.        
    </p>
    <p>Dr Yali Zhang and colleagues at the Monell Chemical Senses Centre in Pennsylvania have found that humans may employ a binary acid-taste response similar to that of fruit flies.</p>
    <p>Human response to acidic foods is thought to be evolutionary based with strongly-acidic foods being linked to danger. But where do we draw the line? Zhang found that the gustatory pathways in fruit flies linked to acid-detection are not so much sweet and sour as they are sour and less sour. Fruit flies use two separate gustatory receptor neurons called GRNs. 
    </p>
    <p>The researchers observed that fruit flies prefer less-acidic foods which stimulate feeding – displaying an “attractive taste response”, while more-acidic foods triggered an aversive response. This attractive-aversive response forms the basis of the binary mechanism. It suggests that the fruit flies are not consuming based on what is the least unappealing but actually going towards what tastes best – in this case low acidity foods.
    </p>
    <p>Zhang puts forward the idea that the two (attractive-aversive) are triggered to varying degrees when presented with an acidic food and it is the dominant reading that determines the organism’s response.
    </p>
    <p>This is supported by the presence of the fruit fly proton receptor Otopetrin-like a (OtopLa) which is required for an attractive response to an acidic food. A two-way mechanism is also supported by the knowledge that OtopLa is only found in one of two sensory organs used by the flies to detect acidity </p>
    <p>OtopLa has an ortholog found in mammals: Otop1 which functions in a similar way. Zhang says: “As the taste receptors dedicated to acid sensation between flies and mammals are well conserved, our fly work provides a practical avenue for fully understanding the acid-taste sensation in mammals, including humans.”
    </p>
    <p>Other research has found that proton-detection may not be the only determining quality of acidity as molecules of undissociated acids may also be perceived as sour. Putting this together with Zhang’s findings suggests a more complex system of gustatory acid detection.</p>
