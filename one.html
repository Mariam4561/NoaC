    <h2>I'm a Chemist, you're a Chemist.</h2>
    <p id="y">It was at an open day years and years ago that a professor told the crowd of us sitting wide-eyed, that the moment we joined the course, we were chemists. Specifically, “I’m a Chemist, you’re a Chemist”. Perhaps that was all I had needed from a prospective university, a welcoming warmth that could overcome the hesitations I had. That, and a flashy lab. 
    </p>
    <p>I never did go to that university but those words have stuck with me.</p>
    <p>Since then, I have experienced countless moments of complete awe during my degree. For instance, learning that NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) readings before digitisation are recorded in KHz and falls into the range for human hearing and so your spectra produces an audible sound. And the quality of your spectra is relative to the quality of sound. 
    </p>
    <p>This past year I successfully produced two ChemComm papers looking at identifying the rate determining step of ester hydrolysis reactions, and the impact of aluminium dopants in lithium cathode materials. It is true, they did not see much but my supervisor’s email inbox, but the experience taught me that I could do it.
    </p>
    <p>It was from that point that I began to look at scientific communication as a pathway for myself. Writing at university level, I found myself explaining concepts to death; subconsciously presenting to a less than an expert audience, which of course is not what you are supposed to do. Nevertheless, I worked it out. That explaining however, is what I really enjoyed. Put simply, what I want to do is to communicate some of the wonderment I feel when a scientific idea clicks in my mind. And ultimately, to foster a sense of belonging in others, that science is for everyone and knowledge is power.
    </p>
    <p>This blog, therefore, will be a place for me to practice scientific writing, as well as to articulate my thoughts with regards to a whole host of topics. </p>
