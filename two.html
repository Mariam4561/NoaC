    <h2>Killing Molecular MachEves? (sorry)</h2>
    <p id="y">If I was to ask you what the singular degree of separation between Nobel prize winning scientist Sir Fraser Stoddart and actress Jodie Comer is, your answer would most likely not be Molecular Machines. 
    </p>
    <p>Scrolling through Instagram and coming across an accurately targeted ad of Jodie Comer advertising a new skincare brand (NoblePanacea) was one thing; reading that it was founded by Sir Fraser Stoddart was quite another. The name immediately rang bells in my head upon which I remembered a small plaque near the entrance of the newly built labs at my university which read: “This Collaborative Teaching Lab was opened by Professor Sir Francis Stoddart”. It was at this point that I started googling intensely.</p>
    <p>Organic Molecular Vessels or OMVs for short, form the basis of the patented technology used in NoblePanacea products. The Organic Molecular Vessel itself is made from smaller structures such that each OMV can house multiple active ingredient molecules. This prevents the breakdown of active agents such as retinol or vitamin c that are sensitive to light and oxygen in the air, increasing their efficacy. It also provides a controlled release mechanism, allowing the product to continue benefiting the skin over time. The philosophy behind this method of administration is rooted in the science of medicine and the importance of the therapeutic window. The therapeutic window is the range of concentrations at which a drug is able to carry out its desired function without becoming toxic or ineffectual. Somewhat overwhelmed with all this knowledge, I went about my day.
    </p>
    <p>It was not until halfway through my final year module in Supramolecular Chemistry, that I came across Stoddart, Sauvage and Feringa’s Nobel prize winning work; Molecular machines. With my interest thoroughly reignited, I decided to read about their work. 
    </p>
    <p>Starting out as a solution to the question of introducing molecular structures held together by mechanical bonds, Sauvage developed the catenane. The catenane is a structure consisting of two interlocked rings. Building upon this, Stoddart’s rotaxane introduced a ring threaded onto an axle. Feringa developed the first molecular motor by using UV light to influence the confirmation of the molecule, encouraging it to rotate to adopt the lowest energy confirmation. Repeating this process saw 360 degree unidirectional motion. Further probing of this chemistry has seen the introduction of molecular muscles, lifts, computer chips and cars. 
    </p>
    <p>The future of such molecular machinery is vast and exciting, and has potential applications in NobelPanacea OMVs are the first of their kind but will certainly not be the last.
    </p>
    <p> If that does not make you jump up with a soaring motivation to do something, maybe keep a look out for the next Nobel Prize winner.
