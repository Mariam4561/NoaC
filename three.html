    <h2>The Myth of Recycling</h2>
    <p id="y">For thousands of years, the idea of limiting waste and being cautious of our intake has been central to our communities and arguably our survival too. The three r’s: reduce, reuse and recycle, in particular, have become household terms. But what do they mean? The phrase emerged with the advent of the first Earth Day which first took place in the United States in 1970. The idea was proposed by erstwhile Senator for Wisconsin - Gaylord Nelson in a bid to turn the tides on the danger posed by the lack of knowledge on protecting the Earth. This whole period characterised a movement in the US to encourage environmental consciousness.

    <p>Focusing in on plastics, their degradation process is a real cause for concern as it can take upwards of 100 years to occur in environmental conditions. On a molecular level this is as a result of the structure of the polymer which informs properties such as degree of crystallinity and hydrophobicity. Other important characteristics of the polymer are it’s surface area and the functional groups present. The importance of these characteristics becomes clear when we look out how plastics degrade. Plastics degrade through the cleavage of monomer-monomer bonds. This is often a hydrolysis process and so requires water molecules to be present. The more tightly knit a polymer network is, the harder it is for these molecules to infiltrate. This translates to a polymer with high crystallinity. 
    </p>
    <p>Plastic recycling is one solution to this problem. In the UK, plastic is recycled after collection by hand-sorting based on properties such as density and colour. At this point some of the plastic will be labelled as low value and lost to landfill. The remaining materials are washed and ground down into flakes. These can then be melted and remoulded into new plastics. One downside of this process is that thermal degradation of these plastics leads to recycled plastics with poorer mechanical properties. More recently, catalytic depolymerisation has been explored. It operates under the idea that breaking down a polymer into its constituent monomers can then allow repolymerisation. The wide-spread application of this process has been limited by long reaction times and the highly endothermic nature of the reaction. 
    </p>
    <p>As it stands, in the UK, only around 45% of all plastics are recycled with the properties of the resulting plastics becoming poorer each time. As well as this, there are still no recycling options for certain plastics like cling film and bubble wrap. Recycling is by no means the solution to the current world crisis. Similar to any risk assessment, the first goal should be to eliminate the risk where necessary before attempting to mitigate it. The same is true of plastic consumption. 
    </p>
    <p> The three R’s are in desperate need of an update. We should be replacing the plastics we use in our lives as well as reducing our intake. Recycling plastic should be the last resort.
